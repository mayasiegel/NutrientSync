## üß± Technical Architecture

### Backend Implementation (Supabase)

#### New Database Tables

**1. `schedule_events`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE schedule_events (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('practice', 'game')),
  title TEXT,
  start_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  end_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  recurrence JSONB, -- { frequency: 'weekly', days: ['monday', 'wednesday'] }
  in_season_only BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  location TEXT,
  opponent TEXT, -- for games
  importance TEXT CHECK (importance IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE schedule_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own schedule" ON schedule_events
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**2. `event_logs`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_logs (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  event_id UUID REFERENCES schedule_events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('practice', 'game')),
  intensity TEXT CHECK (intensity IN ('low', 'moderate', 'high')),
  mood TEXT,
  soreness_level INTEGER CHECK (soreness_level BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
  injury_notes TEXT,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  logged_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE event_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own event logs" ON event_logs
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Database Functions

**Training Load Calculation**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_training_load(user_uuid UUID, days_back INTEGER DEFAULT 7)
RETURNS JSONB AS $$
DECLARE
  result JSONB;
BEGIN
  SELECT jsonb_build_object(
    'total_events', COUNT(*),
    'high_intensity_events', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE intensity = 'high'),
    'moderate_intensity_events', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE intensity = 'moderate'),
    'average_soreness', AVG(soreness_level),
    'last_event_date', MAX(logged_at)
  ) INTO result
  FROM event_logs 
  WHERE user_id = user_uuid 
    AND logged_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * days_back;
  
  RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### Frontend Implementation (React Native/Expo)

#### New Screens

**1. ScheduleScreen.js**
- Calendar view with event management
- Add/edit recurring practices and one-time games
- Season-based filtering
- Integration with existing navigation

**2. EventPromptScreen.js**
- Post-event intensity and mood collection
- Optional injury/soreness tracking
- Direct link to meal planning

**3. ScheduleDashboard.js**
- Weekly/monthly calendar overview
- Quick event status updates
- Integration with daily nutrition goals

#### Key Components

**Calendar Component**
```jsx
// Using react-native-calendars or similar
<Calendar
  markedDates={getMarkedDates()}
  onDayPress={handleDayPress}
  theme={{
    selectedDayBackgroundColor: '#007AFF',
    todayTextColor: '#007AFF',
    arrowColor: '#007AFF',
  }}
/>
```

**Event Form Component**
```jsx
const EventForm = ({ onSubmit, initialData }) => {
  const [eventType, setEventType] = useState('practice');
  const [recurrence, setRecurrence] = useState(null);
  const [inSeasonOnly, setInSeasonOnly] = useState(true);
  
  // Form logic for creating/editing events
};
```

---

## üîî Notification System

### Implementation Strategy

**1. Expo Notifications Setup**
```javascript
// In App.js or notification service
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: true,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
  }),
});
```

**2. Notification Scheduling**
```javascript
const scheduleEventReminders = async (event) => {
  // Pre-event reminder (30 minutes before)
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: `Upcoming ${event.type}`,
      body: `Your ${event.type} starts in 30 minutes. Time to fuel up!`,
      data: { eventId: event.id, type: 'pre_event' },
    },
    trigger: {
      date: new Date(event.start_time.getTime() - 30 * 60 * 1000),
    },
  });
  
  // Post-event prompt (15 minutes after)
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: `How was your ${event.type}?`,
      body: `Log your intensity and get recovery meal suggestions.`,
      data: { eventId: event.id, type: 'post_event' },
    },
    trigger: {
      date: new Date(event.end_time.getTime() + 15 * 60 * 1000),
    },
  });
};
```

## ü§ñ AI Integration Enhancement

### Enhanced Meal Planning Prompts

**Current Prompt Structure:**
```
"Create a meal plan for a [sport] athlete with [goals]..."
```

**Enhanced Prompt Structure:**
```
"Create a meal plan for a [sport] athlete with [goals]. 
Context: 
- Training load: [high/moderate/low] intensity [X] times this week
- Last event: [X] hours ago, intensity: [high/moderate/low]
- Next event: [X] hours from now, type: [practice/game]
- Current soreness level: [X]/10
- Season status: [in-season/off-season]

Recommend meals that support [recovery/preparation] needs."
```

### Training Load Analysis
```javascript
const getTrainingContext = async (userId) => {
  const { data: trainingLoad } = await supabase
    .rpc('calculate_training_load', { 
      user_uuid: userId, 
      days_back: 7 
    });
  
  const { data: upcomingEvents } = await supabase
    .from('schedule_events')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .gte('start_time', new Date().toISOString())
    .order('start_time', { ascending: true })
    .limit(3);
  
  return { trainingLoad, upcomingEvents };
};
```
